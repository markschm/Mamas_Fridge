## Todo
- remove item function
- figure out date formatting
- base frontend setup
- base thing done, start looking into adding features, making it look nicer, and other stuff
    - frontend: add 500ms debounce to item search
    - setup readme
    - on opening application check the close to expiry dates ingredients and warn
    - allow sorting of ingredients on user screen
    - pagination for when there are lots of ingredients saved
    - add an option to make a grocery list too
        - when you finish off an item there will be a button to add that to the grocery list
    - see how much work it'll be to set it up to use on the phone since I feel that'll be the easiest way to use it
